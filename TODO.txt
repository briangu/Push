break up examples into topics to illustrate different features

add code hook to reload modules
add item/value views for versioned dict
add code import / export tools
    github
        pull from github
        version should be hash?
    zip
    enumerate all versions and dump
add task routing based on host requirements

[x] work out the task relationship to global context - can they just write into the repl_ structs?
